# AdapterPattern-PowerOutlet

**Problem statement**
You are developing an application that helps users manage and control various electronic devices by plugging them into power outlets. Each device has different plug types, voltage, and amperage requirements. To ensure compatibility and safety, you need to create adapters for different devices to allow them to be plugged into standard power outlets.

## What this repo contains
- Java implementation of Adapter Pattern for Laptop, Refrigerator, SmartphoneCharger.
- UML class diagram (upload `UML.png` to repo and it will show here).
- Instructions to build and run.
- GitHub Project board for Scrum-driven iterative development.

## UML Diagram

## How to run (example)
This project uses Java. Example with plain `javac` / `java`:
1. `javac src/*.java`
2. `java -cp src Main`

(If using Maven/Gradle, add build instructions here.)

## Contributing / Scrum
