# AdapterPattern-PowerOutlet 

**Problem statement**  
You are developing an application that helps users manage and control various electronic devices by plugging them into power outlets. Each device has different plug types, voltage, and amperage requirements. To ensure compatibility and safety, you need to create adapters for different devices to allow them to be plugged into standard power outlets.

## Contributing / Scrum
We use a central GitHub Project board: **AdapterPattern-PowerOutlet Scrum Board** (linked from this repo or at org/user level).  

- ðŸ‘‰ Check our **Issue Templates** here: [`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE`](https://github.com/engr-julia/AdapterPattern/tree/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE)  
- Tasks and user stories are created with these templates (story, bug, task, etc.).  
- Priorities (`High`, `Medium`, `Low`) are already integrated into issue creation.  
- Issues are automatically linked to the Project board for sprint management.
